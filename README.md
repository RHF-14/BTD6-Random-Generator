Generates up to 4 players with a random hero and up to 5 random monkeys!

I wanted users to still be able to choose paths for the monkeys as I think it adds fun to the game for 2-3 tower chimps, when you need to pick the correct path and crosspath to win the game with fewer towers. This generator adds a bit of difficulty to the standard game, which got a little boring to me.

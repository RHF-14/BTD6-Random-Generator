# README

Generates up to 4 players with a random hero and up to 5 random monkeys!

Also will pick a random map and difficulty.

I wanted users to still be able to choose paths for the monkeys as I think it adds fun to the game for 2-3 tower chimps, when you need to pick the correct path and crosspath to win the game with fewer towers. This generator adds a bit of difficulty to the standard game, which got a little boring to me.

# HOW TO USE
The .exe file is under the "dist" directory. Run the .exe then use the gui to pick how many monkeys and a random map and mode. Then click Gen Player for each player you have in the game to choose a random hero and random monkeys for each player.
